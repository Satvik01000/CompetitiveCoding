The key to solving this problem is to first of all analyze the outputs.

When given `27`, the output is `22`.  
That is because of the digit `7`:  
`9 - 7 = 2` was placed, but we see `2` was not subtracted from `9`,  
as `9 - 2` would result in `7`, which would make the number larger, which is not what we need.

So we see one thing from here:  
9-1=8
9-2=7
9-3=6
9-4=5
9-5=4
9-6=3
9-7=2
9-8=1
9-9=0

We can clearly see that any number before `5` if subtracted from `9` will result in a number greater than `9`,  
so we will only invert the digits that are greater than or equal to `5`.  

Also, one thing to be noted is that the leading place should not have any `0`s.  
This implies that if `9` is at that place, leave it as it isâ€”don't subtract from it.  

Another thing to note is the max size of the input, which is too large.  
So we won't even be using `long long` but will be taking input directly as a string.
