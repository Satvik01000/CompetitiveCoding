### Problem Logic
So what we do to get the max number of buses is assign all the wheels to two axle buses so only 4 wheels at a time are required, for minimum we do the same with three axle buses and hence 6 wheels are required at a time. Some edge cases are if `n` is odd then it is not a valid case because all the tyres must be used and since both the two axle bus and the three axle bus have even number of tyres the total number of tyres cannot be odd. Other thing to consider is if the number of tyres are `<4` we return a `-1` because minimum tyre bus can be a two axle bus having 4 tyres. Thirdly there maybe a confusion that if we are not wasting any tyre then how we get a maximum answer in case the number of tyres are not divisible by `4`, so let's take an example for that, let's take `n=18`, now when we do `n/4` that gives us `4` and remainder as `2`, this gives us a total of `4 two axle buses` and `0 three axle busess`, and `2` tyres remaining which creates wastage. So what we will do is instead of `4 two axle buses` we will take `3 two axle buses` and now we have remaining `4+2=6` tyres hence we get an output of `3 two axle buses` and `1 three axle busess`, and `0` tyres remaining. Similarly there can be another confusion for why we do `n / 6 + (n % 6 > 0)`, we add `(n % 6 > 0)` because the same reasson as of previous edge case now instead of taking all three axle buses we will take a few three axle and few two axle hence not to waste tyress.
