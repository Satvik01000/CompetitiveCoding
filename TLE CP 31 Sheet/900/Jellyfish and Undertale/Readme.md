### Problem Logic
To solve this problem, we first sort the given `tools` array. Then, we wait for `b - 1` secondsâ€”i.e., until `b` becomes `1`. Every time `b` becomes `1`, we use the tool with the highest denomination available to increase the timer. 

However, due to the bug described in the problem, we update `b` using the formula:  
`b = min(1 + increment[i], a)`.  

Here, `1 + increment[i]` accounts for the fact that we are adding `increment[i]` to the remaining time when it is exactly `1`. This ensures maximum utilization of each tool.
