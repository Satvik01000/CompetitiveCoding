### Problem Logic
`GCD(num, 0) = nums`, that is the largest number which can divide `0` in the range `[0, num]`. So what we will do is we will first make the minimum of the both numbers `0` and subtract that many steps from both of the numbers this way we will get the highest possible GCD we will get.
