### Problem Logic
In the problem the elements of `c` should not be a divisor of any element of `b` but vice versa is not true elements of `b` can divide elements of `c`. What we will do is insert all the largest elements of the array `a` into `c`, this way all elements of `b` are smaller than elements of `c` hence any element in `c` cannot be a divisor of any element of `b`.
