### Black and White Stripe
[Black and White Stripe](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1690/D)

### Problem Logic
This is a simple constant size sliding window problem, we will maintain a sliding window of size and check how many blacks and whites are there in total inside the window then window which needs minimum number of changes to be changed into a constant window of size `k` of all `black stripes` we will return that as an answer.
