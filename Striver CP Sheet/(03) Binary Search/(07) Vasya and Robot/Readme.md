## 🧠 **Problem Summary (In Simple Words):**

You have a robot starting at point **(0, 0)** and a string of moves like `"RURUU"` which it will follow.

Each move is:

* `U` = up (+y)
* `D` = down (-y)
* `L` = left (-x)
* `R` = right (+x)

You’re given a **target point (x, y)** and asked:

> ❓ What's the minimum number of **consecutive moves** you need to **change** in the sequence so that the robot **ends up at (x, y)** instead?

---

## 🧠 Key Observations:

1. You can’t insert or delete moves — only change them.
2. You want to change **the smallest possible window (subsegment)** of operations.
3. You can choose **any subsegment**, but you must keep its **length minimum**.

## 🪄 The Magic Idea — Binary Search + Sliding Window

### Why Binary Search?

Because:

* If a solution is possible in length `k`, it is also possible in length `k+1`, `k+2`, etc.
* So we can binary search on the **minimum length** `len` of the subsegment we need to change.

### For each length `len`, how do we check if it's valid?

We slide a window of size `len` across the operations string:

* In each window, imagine replacing all operations in that window with **whatever moves we want**.
* Outside the window, we **keep the moves as they are**.

We ask:

> Can we reach (x, y) by keeping outer operations and changing the inside window?

If **yes**, `len` is possible.

## 🧮 How Do We Check If It’s Valid?

Let’s say you fix a window from `i` to `i + len - 1`.

### 1. Compute where the robot would go **without** that window:

* You do this using **prefix sums** (`px` and `py`) of movement in the string.

```cpp
int curX = px[i] + (px[n] - px[i + len]);
int curY = py[i] + (py[n] - py[i + len]);
```

This means:

* Add position from \[0 to i-1]
* Add position from \[i+len to n-1]
* Together: this is your **final position if the window was removed**

### 2. From `curX, curY` → how many moves needed to get to `(x, y)`?

```cpp
int dx = abs(x - curX);
int dy = abs(y - curY);
```

We need to reach (x, y) from (curX, curY). The shortest path will take `dx + dy` moves.

### 3. Can we do it within `len` moves?

```cpp
if (dx + dy <= len && (len - dx - dy) % 2 == 0)
```

Explanation:

* ✅ Total needed moves `dx + dy` must be ≤ `len`
* ✅ The rest moves (extra ones) must be even because robot moves in steps of 1 unit — odd distance cannot be done in even steps and vice versa.

If both conditions hold, we **can** reach (x, y) from curX, curY by modifying that window.

## 🔁 Summary of Each Function

### `move(char c)`

Returns how the robot moves with that character.

### `isPossible(len, s, x, y)`

Checks if **any** window of size `len` can be modified to help robot reach `(x, y)`

### `pathChange(s, x, y)`

Does a binary search on `len` from `0` to `n`:

* For each `len`, calls `isPossible()`
* Tries to minimize the window length

## 🧠 Real Intuition: What This Problem Teaches You

This problem is a mix of:

* Binary search on **answers**
* Sliding window to check **windows of fixed size**
* Prefix sum to quickly compute robot’s partial movements
* Greedy + math (Manhattan distance and parity check)

## 🔍 Example:

```txt
Input:
5
RURUU
-2 3
```

Moves:

```
R → (1,0)
U → (1,1)
R → (2,1)
U → (2,2)
U → (2,3)
Final pos = (2,3)
```

Target: (-2, 3)

So x-difference = 4 → We need 4 left moves somewhere.

If we change the segment `[0..2]` = "RUR" → change to "LUL", new path becomes:

```
L → (-1,0)
U → (-1,1)
L → (-2,1)
U → (-2,2)
U → (-2,3)
```

Perfect! We reached (-2,3). Length of changed segment = 3 → Answer ✅

## 📌 Final Takeaway:

The cleverness lies in:

* **Transforming the question** from “how to reach (x, y)” → “can we remove a part and replace it smartly?”
* Using **prefix sums + sliding windows** for speed
* Applying **binary search** to minimize the result efficiently
