# Anton and Polyhedrons

[Anton and Polyhedrons](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/785/A)
### Problem logic
Simple and straight forward question just to optimize the calculation have a notice that all the
regular polyhedrons that are mentioned have a different starting letter so instead of taking an input
then going through the whole string and then mapping accordingly just map based on the first character.
