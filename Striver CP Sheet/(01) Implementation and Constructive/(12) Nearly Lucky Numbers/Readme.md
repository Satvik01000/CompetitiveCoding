# Nearly Lucky Number
[Nearly Lucky Number](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/110/A)

### Problem Logic
Main thing in this problem is to understand that as the input is so big we will be taking a string as an input.
Then just normally traverse the string and find out wether the number is nearly lucky or not, note that we don't need to find wether it is lucky number or not we just need to find wether it is nearly lucky.
