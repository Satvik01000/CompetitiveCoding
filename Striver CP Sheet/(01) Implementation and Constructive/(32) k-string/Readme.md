[k-String](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/219/A)

### Problem Logic
In this we will find the frequency of every character that is present and then check if the frequency is divisible by `k`, this will make sure that when `k` groups are made that character can be divided `k` times, and if not then `return -1;`
