# Digital Root
[Digital Root](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1107/B)

### Problem Logic
This is a pattern observation based problem, `x` can only lie between `1 and 9`, so first number which will be the digital root is number itself, now here comes an observational pattern, when we add `9` to any single digit integer the answer will always end up in a number which sums back to that number or can be converted via digital root to that number.
