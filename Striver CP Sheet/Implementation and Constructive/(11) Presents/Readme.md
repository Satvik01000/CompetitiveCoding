### Problem Logic
The main crux in this problem is the weird language of the question.
Let's understand the question in layman terms, the array that is to be taken as input
represents ith friend gave gift to arr[i]th friend for example for the array
`2 3 4 1`, the 1st friend gave gift to 2nd friend, yes we count from 0 but count the friend
number as 1, i.e. i=0 to be counted as friend number = 1.
