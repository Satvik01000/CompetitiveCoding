### Problem Logic
In this problem see the test cases for example the first test case which is 117, write the table of 117 till 10, what we observe at `117*9=1053`, is `1053%10=3`, i.e. the `r` that we have, in other words we have just one `r`, so we go from 1 to 10 and if we find the last digit to ever be `r` or `0` that is our answer.
