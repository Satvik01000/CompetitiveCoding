# Mahmoud and Ehab and the even-odd game
[Mahmoud and Ehab and the even-odd game](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/959/A)

### Problem Logic
The key in this is `odd - even` is always an `odd` number if `Ehbab` choses an odd number as his favorite then no matter what he will win because `Mahmoud` can only choose an even number no matter what even number he chooses the result will be an odd number and `Ehbab` can easily choose his next number as that resulting odd number resulting in a sum of `0` and hence making `Mahmoud` loose, similarly if `Ehbab` chooses an even number then `Mahmoud` can right away choose that as his next number and win the game right away.
