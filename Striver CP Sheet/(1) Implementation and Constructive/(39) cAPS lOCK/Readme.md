### Problem Logic
Very simple question with a lot of edge cases, we just need to first of all find if a word is a valid error according to the given conditions which is check if all the letters are upper-case in that case the correct answer will be all the letters turned to lowercase, and the second on is except the first one all are upper case, in that the first one will be turned to upper case and all others will be turned to lower case, any other type of word except these two has to be returned as is.
